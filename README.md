# Brain-MRI-Tumor-Detection
My Semantic Segmentation implementation to detect tumor by using Brain MRI records. 

This repository contains a CNN Segmentation model detecting brain tumors. ResUnet structure is used to build the model.
Initially, I had a problem stemming from the discrepancy between the loss function and the output shape. You can observe my 
initial codes and final resolution. Moreover, you can observe the significance of determining true loss function in medical
semantic segmentation cases. Having utilized some source codes, I specified the authors and sources in the notebook.
